##### Spark deploy instructions on UPPMAX #####

# These are instructions for deploying Apache Spark.
# They include a hacks relevant for the SNIC cloud, which we wouldn't use for a production system.
# For the lab, a spark cluster has already been deployed -- this will be an experiment!

# 0. Create a virtual machine (or use an existing one), this instance will be used for both the Spark master and a worker.
#    Choose a suitable flavor.
#    Use Ubuntu 20.04 as the source image.
# 0. Add a floating IP to the VM
# 0. Configure the ~/.ssh/config on your local laptop/desktop/lab computer like this.
#    This is for the university lab machines or other unix-like systems and (Windows Subsystem for Linux) WSL, you may have
#    to modify the instructions if you are using some other system):

# replace 130.238.x.y and ~/.ssh/id_rsa with your floating IP and key path appropriately.

# This will open ssh-tunnels (for the given ports) between your local computer and the VM. This will enable you to access e.g a jupyter
# notebook via your browser by localhost:8888. Note: the first port listed is the port on your local machine, localhost:XXXX refers to the remote machine.

# Note: having setup the config file, when you connect with SSH do it like this (without any additional parameters).
# ssh 130.238.x.y

## For this example, we'll install Spark worker and master on the same virual machine. Normally we'd put the master on its own machine.

# update apt repo metadata
sudo apt update

# install java (version up to you, but must be >= 8)
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk


# manually define a hostname for all the hosts on the de1 project. this will ensure connections of spark between difference instances:
# NOTE! if you have added entries to /etc/hosts yourself, you need to remove those.
for i in {1..255}; do echo "192.168.1.$i host-192-168-1-$i-de1"| sudo tee -a /etc/hosts; done
for i in {1..255}; do echo "192.168.2.$i host-192-168-2-$i-de1"| sudo tee -a /etc/hosts; done

# set the hostname according to the scheme above:
sudo hostname host-$(hostname -I | awk '{$1=$1};1' | sed 's/\./-/'g)-de1 ; hostname

# change the /etc/hostname file to the host name you get from last command (in the form of host-192-168-x-xxx-de1)

##### Install HDFS (e.g. to connect to cluster) #####

# This section describes how to install Hadoop to allow you to add your own files to the Hadoop Cluster.

# We assume we've already installed Java above (OpenJDK).
# HDFS needs to know where Java is... we use an environment variable for this.
# Lets put it in the .bashrc file so we don't need to set it each time
echo "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64" >> ~/.bashrc

# Run the file so its available now.
source ~/.bashrc

# Download hadoop: (You can choose the version of hadoop you prefer, but make sure the spark version is corresponded to hadoop's version)
cd ~
wget https://downloads.apache.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-3.3.6/hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz

tar -xvf hadoop-3.3.6.tar.gz

# Set up the hadoop environment according to youe cluster mode
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html

# Now we can use HDFS to copy files in and out of the storage cluster for use with Spark:
# The namenode host can be set in the config file core-site.xml, or as here, directly on the command line. (use your ip address instead)
~/hadoop-3.3.6/bin/hdfs dfs -Dfs.defaultFS="hdfs://192.168.2.250:9000" -ls /

# Notes
# 1. Please don't attempt to connect your namenodes/datanodes to the existing cluster!
# 2. This is a shared resource, use it sensibly. Please keep an eye on disk space.
# 3. You can always use the local storage system for spark if you don't need data accessment from other devices.

##### Spark Master/Worker #####

cd ~

# download Spark (find the correct version by yourself, make sure the versions of hadoop, spark, and pyspark are consistent)
# (for Hadoop 3.3.6 (3+))
wget https://downloads.apache.org/spark/spark-3.5.0/spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz

tar -zxvf spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3.tgz

# Tell Spark that we're using Python 3 -- we need to use the same version of Python everywhere.
echo "export SPARK_HOME=~/spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc


cd ~/spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3/


# lets have a look at what's in the spark directories.
ls -l

# start the master on the current machine:
~/spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3/sbin/start-master.sh


# start the worker on the current machine (and tell it where the master is listening -- the IP address of our master node from above):
~/spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3/sbin/start-worker.sh spark://192.168.X.Y:7077


# is it running?
jps

# After this, you will need to setup security groups for the firewall configuration. Have a look how its done for the shared cluster.

########################################################################################################################
##### Install the Python Notebook -- RESUME HERE FOR THE LAB  #####

########################################################################################################################
##### Install the Python Notebook #####

# Env variable so the workers know which Python to use...
echo "export PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# install git
sudo apt-get install -y git

# install python dependencies, start notebook

# install the python package manager 'pip' -- it is recommended to do this directly 
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

# check the version:
#python3 -m pip --version

# install pyspark (the matching version as the cluster), and some other useful deps (if running on user account add --user)
python3 -m pip install pyspark==3.5.0 (--user)
python3 -m pip install pandas (--user)
python3 -m pip install matplotlib (--user)

# clone the examples from the lectures, so we have a copy to experiment with
git clone https://github.com/JSFRi/DE1-spark.git

# install jupyterlab
python3 -m pip install jupyterlab (--user)

# start the notebook!
jupyter lab

# ...follow the instructions you see -- copy the 'localhost' link into your browser.

# Now you can run the examples from the lectures in your own notebook.
# Using the Jupyter Notebook, navigate into the directory you just cloned from GitHub.
# Start with a demo notebook
# Ensure the host is set correctly for the Spark master, and namenode, to:
#  192.168.2.250

# When you start your application, you'll see it running in the Spark master web GUI (link at the top).
# If you hover over the link to your application, you'll see the port number for the Web GUI for your application.
# It will be 4040,4041,...
# You can open the GUI in your web browser like this (e.g.):
#   http://localhost:4040

##### Creating your own notebook that deploys spark jobs to the cluster #####

# When working on your own notebooks, save them in your own repository (for example which you created in A1, do a git clone) and
# make sure to commit and push changes often (for backup purposes).

# You need to share the Spark cluster with the other students:

# 1. Start your application with dynamic allocation enabled, a timeout of no more than 30 seconds, and a cap on CPU cores: (fixed driver/blockManager port for security group)

spark_session = SparkSession\
        .builder\
        .master("spark://192.168.2.250:7077") \
        .appName("your_application_name")\
        .config("spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled", True)\
        .config("spark.dynamicAllocation.shuffleTracking.enabled",True)\
        .config("spark.shuffle.service.enabled", False)\
        .config("spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout","300s")\
        .config("spark.executor.cores",2)\
        .config("spark.driver.port",9999)\
        .config("spark.blockManager.port",10005)\
        .getOrCreate()

# 2. Put your name in the name of your application.
# 3. Kill your application when your have finished with it.
# 4. Don't interfere with any of the virtual machines in the cluster.
# 5. Run one app at a time.
# 6. When the lab is not running, you can use more resources, but keep an eye on other people using the system.
